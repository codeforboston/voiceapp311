Running all tests for project:

    from PROJECT_ROOT:
    	 (PROJECT_ROOT)$ python run_tests.py



test_dir_structure:
	|
	|
	|
	----unit_tests: unit-y tests (there are some integration-like tests here)
	|
	|
	|
	----integration_tests: tests of intents with network resources mocked
	|
	|
	|
	|
	----test_constants.py: contains some file_paths and mocked_return_values
	|    for patched functions in integration_tests modules
	|
	|
	|
	----test_data: mostly unused for now, most of the relevant data has been 
	    incorporated into test_constants.py


Creating an integration_test for some_intent.py:


1. import mycity.test.integration_tests.intent_test_mixins 
     - contains common test functions like testing if response.output_speech
     has an error message, the card title is correctly configured, etc.

2. import mycity.test.integration_tests.intent_base_case
    - does the setUp and tearDown common to all intents 
    - if you need to do some function patching or some other setup, overwrite
    setUp and tearDown in child class, but don't forget to call super().setUp()
    and super().tearDown(), respectively

3. if you need a return value for a mocked function, write and store it in
mycity.test.test_constants and reference it as mycity.test.test_constants.SOME_VALUE.


class SomeIntentTestCase(mix_ins.RepromptTextTestMixIn,
	                 mix_ins.TestForOutputSpeechErrorMixIn,
			 base_case.IntentBaseCase):

    intent_to_test = "SomeIntent"
    returns_reprompt_text = False

    def setUp(self): 
        super().setUp() 
	 ...patch whatever functions you need to
        (don't forget to start the patch/es)...

    def tearDown(self):
        super().tearDown()
	...stop all your patches...

    def test_that_is_unique_to_this_intent(self): 
        ...do whatever you need to! Mixed-in tests will rely on your setUp 
	and tearDown for any needed patching tho

4. make sure you add your testCase to TEST_CASES in run_tests.py!
